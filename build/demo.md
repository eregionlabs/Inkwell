# Travel Notes: Three Days in Kyoto

## Day 1 — Temples and Tea

Arrived at **Kyoto Station** around noon. The city immediately feels different from Tokyo — quieter, older, more deliberate. Dropped bags at the ryokan and headed straight to **Fushimi Inari**.

> "The thousand torii gates aren't just a photo op — they're a meditation. Each gate was donated by a business praying for prosperity. Commerce as devotion."

The hike to the summit took about 90 minutes. Most tourists stop at the halfway point, so the upper trails were almost empty. Worth the sweat.

### Evening: Gion District

Wandered through Gion at dusk. Spotted two maiko (apprentice geisha) hurrying between appointments. Had dinner at a tiny kappo restaurant — only 8 seats at the counter:

| Course | Dish | Notes |
|--------|------|-------|
| 1 | Sakizuke | Sesame tofu with yuzu |
| 2 | Owan | Clear dashi with matsutake |
| 3 | Yakimono | Grilled barramundi, miso glaze |
| 4 | Gohan | Rice with pickled plum |

**Cost:** ¥8,500 ($57). Absurdly good value.

## Day 2 — Gardens and Getting Lost

Rented a bicycle. This is the *only* way to see Kyoto properly. The city is flat and compact — everything is 15 minutes away.

### Morning Itinerary

1. **Kinkaku-ji** (Golden Pavilion) — arrive by 8:30 to beat crowds
2. **Ryoan-ji** — the famous rock garden, 15 rocks, can only see 14 from any angle
3. **Arashiyama Bamboo Grove** — surreal, even with other visitors

### Useful Japanese Phrases

```
Sumimasen        — Excuse me / I'm sorry
Kore wa nan desu ka  — What is this?
Oishii desu      — It's delicious
Ikura desu ka    — How much is it?
Arigatou gozaimasu   — Thank you very much
```

## Day 3 — The Philosopher's Path

Walked the **2km canal path** from Ginkaku-ji to Nanzen-ji. Cherry trees line both sides — in full bloom they must be extraordinary. Even in autumn, the maple leaves made it feel like walking through a painting.

### What I'd Do Differently

- Skip the Nishiki Market before 10am (half the stalls aren't open)
- Book the moss temple **Saihō-ji** weeks in advance — I missed it
- Bring a portable charger; Google Maps drains battery fast
- Stay *at least* 4 nights, not 3

**Next trip:** Planning a return in spring for hanami season. Need to research ryokans in the Higashiyama district.
